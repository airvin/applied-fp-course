-- We're going to add a very useful abstraction to our application. We'll
-- automate away the explicit error handling and inspection of our Either values
-- while preserving the type-level information that tells us what can go wrong.
--
-- To do this we will create a newtype `AppM` that is a shorthand way of
-- describing the return type of a function that may contain an error.
--
-- Our `AppM` type will work in the same manner as the Functor/Applicative/Monad
-- instances for Either, with functions being applied to the Right value and
-- everything been ignored if a Left value is encountered, returning that Left
-- value. With the added bonus of allowing us to perform `IO` actions!
--
-- f <$> (Left e)  = Left e
-- f <$> (Right a) = Right (f a)
--
-- (Left e)  >>= f = Left e
-- (Right a) >>= f = f a
--
-- This means when we have a function doing this sort of shuffling:
--
-- foo :: IO (Either Error Value)
-- foo = do
--   aE <- mightFail
--   either (pure . Left) needsAButMightFail aE
--   where
--     mightFail :: IO (Either Error Int)
--     needsAButMightFail :: Int -> IO (Either Error Value)
--
-- We can wrap our functions with AppM and we can work directly with the
-- values we expect to appear on the happy path, knowing that if the sad path is
-- encountered, the structure of our AppM will automatically handle it for us.

newtype AppM a = AppM (IO (Either Error a))
-- This structure allows us to start writing our functions in terms of
-- constraints. As an example, if we wanted to abstract over IO and indicate
-- that instead of the concrete type we wanted a constraint that allows for IO
-- actions. Our AppM would look more like this:
--
-- AppM m a = AppM ( m (Either Error a) )
--
-- Then our functions would look like:
--
-- foo :: MonadIO m => Int -> AppM m a
--
-- Or we could not use a concrete type for Error
--
-- AppM e m a = AppM ( m (Either e a) )
